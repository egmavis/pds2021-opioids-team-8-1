# The Impact of Opioid Control Policies
Team 8: Emma Mavis, Fides Schwartz, Weiliang Hu, Yongxin Tan

Below are the introduction and conclusion of the final report which outlines the motivation for and limitations of this analysis. 

### Motivation For Project

Beginning in the late 1990s, the United States has undergone an opioid addiction crisis, initially due to an over-prescription and over-use of painkillers, and then perpetuated by the use of illegal drugs. This has led to an increase in opioid-overdose deaths and the number of illegal drugs being shipped into the country. Policymakers in many states have tried to address these problems by implementing new legislation that attempts to limit who can prescribe opioids and control the flow of opioids from other countries as well as within the U.S. This project is motivated by the need to evaluate the effects of such policies, so other states may follow successful examples and forego attempts at implementing policies that have proven unsuccessful. 
  
### Limitations

It is important to keep in mind that while analyzing the outcomes of policy changes on a state level is relevant, a useful addition would be to complete the same analyses on a national level in order to tease out more general versus local effects. There are many strategies that can be and have been adopted, including raising awareness in the medical community over opioid prescriptions, which may affect opioid shipments to pharmacies more than a policy change might; or there could be changes to drug enforcement policies or to opioid buyback programs .
In addition, this data is solely focused on the U.S. and several of its states, but it could be relevant to take into account how illicit drug use might be fueled by changes in policies in our neighboring countries, like Canada, Mexico, Central America, and South America.
